       <p>In the age of precision farming, certain crops are emerging as the biggest beneficiaries of cutting-edge e-Crop innovations. The Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI), an ICAR institute located in Thiruvananthapuram, has developed e-Crop (electronic crop), an Internet of Things (IoT) device that uses text messages to give farmers crop-specific agro advisories, further extending the use of AI in the agricultural sector.</p>
       <p>The main developer of this technology is Dr. V.S. Santhosh Mithra, a Principal Scientist at ICAR-CTCRI. This device is a patent product and has been licensed to Precision Grow, a division of Tech Visit IT Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai facilitated by Agrinnovate, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi.
       </p>
       <p>It is a weather-resistant electronic device, developed to work in any terrain in various climatic conditions. The device consists of a main control unit to which sensors are attached to collect various soil and weather parameters.</p>
       <h5>Importance of e-Crop</h5>
       <p>The e-crop-based smart farming is highly beneficial as compared to traditional farming due to the precise application of fertilizer and water through fertigation depending on the climate and plant growth in real-time.</p>
       <p>This tool calculates nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and water requirements for field crops, aiming to minimize yield gaps. By utilizing smart tools, farmers can identify crop health anomalies and address them effectively, reducing the risk of yield losses.</p>
       <p>With the successful application of this technology, the yield gap in traditional farming has been reduced from 50% to 5% for bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, and elephant foot yam. Additionally, farmers that follow e-Crop-based advice can reduce their water and nutrient use by 25â€“50%.
       </p>
       <h5>Top 5 Crops Thriving with e-Crop Technology</h5>
       <p>e-Crop is a precision farming device that collects real-time field data and provides farmers with crop management advisories, ensuring better care and improved results. Here are the top 5 crops benefiting the most from e-Crop technology.</p>
       <div className='row'>
        <div className='col-lg-6'>
        <ul className='list-style-square'>
        <li>
       
            <p><strong>Cassava - </strong>In tropical and subtropical areas, cassava is one of the most significant staple crops. However, pest infestations, water stress, and poor soil quality frequently limit its productivity. Now that e-Crop technology has been put into place, farmers can keep an eye on environmental variables like soil moisture, nutrient levels, and pest activity in real-time. By utilizing data-driven insights, e-Crop assists in managing fertilizer usage, anticipating pest outbreaks, and optimizing irrigation schedules, resulting in healthier crops and increased yields.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Sweet potato - </strong> Sweet potatoes are a multipurpose crop that is grown for its high nutritional content as well as for food. However, irregular soil quality, pest problems, and unpredictable weather patterns frequently hinder its growth. For tackling these issues, e-Crop technology has been revolutionary. Farmers may optimize growing conditions and improve crop management techniques by employing sensors to gather information on temperature, humidity, and soil factors. The real-time guidance system offered by e-Crop also assists farmers in mitigating the dangers posed by climate change, which eventually results in more reliable yields.</p>

        </div>
       </div>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Maize -</strong> Corn, often known as maize, is an essential commodity for industrial uses, animal feed, and food security. However, issues with maize production include nutrient shortages, soil erosion, and changing weather patterns. With e-Crop technology, maize farmers can continuously monitor soil health, watch weather forecasts, and receive individualized crop advice. Through the use of data-driven decisions about pest control, fertilizer, and irrigation, e-Crop technology assists maize farmers in increasing yield and quality while minimizing resource waste.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Rice -</strong> For billions of people worldwide, particularly in Asia, rice is a basic diet. However, there are problems with pests, ineffective fertilizer use, and water scarcity in rice farming. Rice farming requires accurate water management systems and soil health monitoring, which e-Crop technology provides. Farmers may maximize their use of water resources and avoid both over- and under-irrigation by using e-Crop, which provides real-time notifications on irrigation requirements. This results in more productive rice, healthier crops, and less water waste.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cotton -</strong> Cotton production, an important cash crop cultivated throughout the world, is often disrupted by pests, diseases, and water stress. e-Crop technology is essential to cotton farming. Precise water and fertilizer delivery is made possible by sensors that track soil moisture, pH, temperature, and nutrients. Farmers can employ targeted pesticides when e-Crop's pest detection system warns them of dangers like bollworms. This technology minimizes the impact on the environment, lowers expenses, and increases yields.</p></li>
    </ul>
       
       <p><strong>The adoption of e-Crop has significantly raised agricultural productivity. In reality, it is among the few fields where the full potential of labor-saving gadgets has been realized. With the aid of machinery, a farmer can now perform tasks that many men and women complete. Apart from saving time, it reduces expenses and increases production.</strong></p>
