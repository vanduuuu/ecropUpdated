       <p>Most of the agricultural crops in India have been badly affected by the effects of global climate change. As the global population continues to grow and the demand for food increases, farmers are under increasing pressure to increase production while facing unpredictable weather, limited resources, and various environmental challenges.
       </p>
       <p>e-crop technology is an invention that has the potential to completely change the agricultural sector. This innovative approach combines artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, satellite imaging, and data analytics to help farmers make well-informed crop management decisions.
       </p>
       
       <h5>e-Crop: what is it?</h5>
       <p>e-Crop technology is a digital system that collects real-time data from multiple sources, including weather stations, satellite imaging, field sensors, and even drones. AI algorithms are used to evaluate the health of the crops, forecast yields, and suggest the best management techniques based on this data, providing actionable insights to farmers.
       </p>
       <p>The innovation was developed and patented by ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (ICAR-CTCRI) and is produced by Precision Grow, a division of Tech Visit IT Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai division organized by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi's Agrinnovate.</p>
       <h5>How e-Crop Technology Works?</h5>
       <p>e-Crop technology uses AI to analyze data on soil moisture, temperature, crop health, and weather, providing forecasts on yields, pest infestation, disease outbreaks, and factors affecting productivity. The e-Crop system uses advanced algorithms and simulation models to analyze the data collected. Which farmers receive through mobile apps or SMS.</p>
       <p>Farmers receive notifications through SMS or an app about the predicted yield per hectare, as well as schedules for irrigation and fertilizer application. They also get recommendations for managing diseases and pests.</p>
       <p>This enables them to make proactive decisions while ensuring optimum yields. This device provides real-time agro-advisory for any crop, helping to minimize yield gaps and achieve the desired yield targets.</p>

        <div className='col-lg-5'>
        <h5>Why does every farmer need e-Crop?</h5>
        <p>It is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) device, which helps to do precision farming in a smart way. Farmers continue to get correct information from the fields regularly even when they are away from the fields. The integration of auto-fertigation systems and drone-based input applications facilitates precise and timely interventions, which are crucial for optimal crop management.</p>

       <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Achieve food security in climate-change situations</strong><br/>
e-Crop helps achieve easier food production in climate change scenarios. In extreme weather conditions, you can easily grow fruits and vegetables by using nutrient solutions that contain minerals instead of soil or grow crop varieties that are drought-resistant and disease-resistant.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Allow careful management of land</strong><br/>
          This smart farming focuses on managing the land supply and focusing on the right growing parameters to ensure production for the right product in demand. Technologies like GPS, remote sensing, and drones allow farmers to collect appropriate data about soil conditions, crop health, and weather.
</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Predicting Prices and Enhancing Quality</strong><br/>
Marketing is another important area of ​​importance for farmers. Fluctuation in market prices is a very serious matter. AI can provide precise predictions regarding the demand, supply, and pricing of spices. Another area of ​​AI application in marketing is the efficient sorting and grading of products based on various quality parameters.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce ecological footprints of farming</strong><br/>
Application inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides can reduce leaching problems and greenhouse gas emissions. The use of sensor networks allows continuous monitoring of the farm to determine any potential threats.<br/>
A farmer's profit increases both by boosting yield and reducing the cost of cultivation.

       </ul>
       <h5>Practical Insights from e-Crop-Based Smart Farming (eCBSF)</h5>
       <p>e-Crop-based smart farming (eCBSF) was demonstrated in farmers’ fields in five panchayats, Anad, Aruvikkara, Vembayam, Karakulam and Panavoor of Nedumangadu block, Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala. The project was led by Dr. V.S. Santosh Mithra, a Principal Scientist at ICAR-CTCRI, with funding support from the State Horticultural Mission-Kerala (SHM-K). Five farmers were chosen to take part in the campaign, which involved showcasing eCBSF practices, from each panchayat. This approach has been rigorously tested and validated through various trials since 2014. Farmers adopted two farming methods, their traditional farming methods (TF) and the eCBSF method, allowing direct comparison of results.</p>
       <img src={ecropyielmap} alt="Future_Of_Crop_Yield_Predictions_Ecrop_Technology"/>
       <p>The results presented in Figure 1 highlight the substantial benefits of e-Crop Based Smart Farming (eCBSF) over Traditional Farming (TF) in terms of yield and input efficiency. Across the four crops studied, Sweet Potato, Cassava, Banana, and Elephant Foot Yam (EFY), eCBSF achieved significantly higher yields, with increases of 218%, 187%, 152%, and 218%, respectively, compared to TF. This impressive yield improvement was accomplished with a significant reduction in fertilizer inputs. Uses 49% less nitrogen, 73% less phosphorus, and 57% less potassium compared to TF. These results highlight how eCBSF is a sustainable and creative approach to contemporary agriculture since it not only increases output but also encourages resource efficiency.</p>
      
<p><b><i>The concept of smart farming is not new. The Green Revolution in industrialized countries is already being promoted by smart farming. Now is the time to embrace this technology and revolutionize our economy. We can set an example of smart farming and become a world leader in sustainable agriculture.</i></b></p>
